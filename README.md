# Flashcard Project

Flashcard project is an application that can be used to create and test your knowledge of the given topics (JavaScript, HTML, CSS). 

User is able to go through existing questions by pressing the next button on the page, submit their own question/example/hint/answer by using the form below, change categories by pressing on the category that they would like to study, and delete the flashcard.

We plan to implement features such as editing the flashcard, answer input, user accounts, and answer input comparison to the actual answer.
