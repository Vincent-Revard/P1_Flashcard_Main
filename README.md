# Flashcard Project

Flashcard project is an application that can be used to create and test your knowledge of the given topics (JavaScript, HTML, CSS). 

User is able to go through existing questions by pressing the next button on the page, submit their own question/example/hint/answer by using the form below, change categories by pressing on the category that they would like to study, and delete the flashcard.

We plan to implement features such as editing the flashcard, answer input, user accounts, and answer input comparison to the actual answer. 

## Installation

1. Fork the repository
2. Open with visual studio code
3. Run json server by typing 'json-server --watch db.json' in the terminal
4. Open up a separate terminal and type open index.html for Mac OS or explorer.exe for Windows.  

## Usage

You can go through the entire set of cards with next button and end it with a bang of confetti!

You can also submit forms, but make sure you click on categories and fill those boxes out before trying! Deleting flashcard works too!
